A collection of Homebrew Casks & Formulae for old or unsupported macOS
(Currently just Monterey).

The idea behind this Tap is to provide installers for some tools or old
abandonware.
Whether through forked maintained alternative versions of those tools, or by
providing a version-pinned old installer.

Think of this like the "Island of Misfit Toys" for macOS software that has been
made hard to install by Apple's [Planned Obsolescence][planned-obsolescence],
Homebrew maintainer's over-eager deprecations, community abandonment the
[Hype Cycle's][hype-cycle] "_Trough of Disillusionment_", and other such
emergent scenarios from community behaviors.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install lyraphase/right2repair/<cask>`

Or `brew tap lyraphase/right2repair` and then `brew install --cask <cask>`
or `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) and
[`homebrew-cask`](http://caskroom.io/) if you haven't yet.

Then, run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap lyraphase/right2repair

## Usage

**Note**: For info run:

    brew info --cask <cask>

Once the tap is installed, you can install the Casks!

    brew install --cask <cask>

To uninstall run:

    brew uninstall --cask <cask>

### Casks

Casks included in this Tap:

- [`vmware-fusion@13.5.2`][vmware-fusion] - The last version of VMWare Fusion
  Pro that works on macOS Monterey. [Free for personal use][vmware-fusion-free].

### Formula

- [`rancher-machine`][rancher-machine] - A maintained fork of `docker-machine`

### Upgrading

This Homebrew Tap contains some Casks that can not be auto-upgraded, and some
that can.

Below are some helpful commands for upgrading.

To view all outdated Casks on your system, run:

    brew outdated --cask --greedy

To check if a single Cask is outdated, (e.g.: `rancher-machine`):

    brew outdated --greedy rancher-machine

To upgrade a single Cask (e.g.: `rancher-machine`):

    brew upgrade --greedy rancher-machine

To upgrade an `installer manual` Cask (e.g.: `soundid-reference`):

    brew reinstall  --cask soundid-reference

To upgrade all outdated Casks on your system, run:

    brew outdated --cask  --quiet --greedy | xargs brew upgrade --cask
